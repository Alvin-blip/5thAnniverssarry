      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p class="justified-text"><font color="white">In the halls of Asian Institute of Computer Studies, our love story began with a simple Rubik's Cube. Just like this puzzle, our relationship has seen its fair share of challenges and complexities. We've argued, puzzled, and solved problems, but through it all, we never tire of finding solutions together. Our love is a beautiful journey of growth and understanding, where we face each challenge with unwavering determination. Like the colors of the Rubik's Cube coming together in harmony, our hearts intertwine, creating a love that knows no bounds. With each passing day, our bond grows stronger, and our love becomes an ever-evolving masterpiece.</font></p>

            <h2>Our first met</h2>
            <p class="justified-text">In our school days, as classmates, a captivating moment unfolded on the first day. I sat behind her, casually playing with my Rubik's cube. She turned around, her eyes drawn to the colorful puzzle in my hands. Little did I know that this simple encounter would spark something special.<br><br>

              Her seatmate playfully challenged her, promising snacks if she could solve the Rubik's cube. Curiosity got the better of her, and she borrowed my Rubik's cube. As she attempted to solve it, I couldn't help but observe her struggle. There was something intriguing about the way she approached the challenge.<br><br>
              
              Eventually, she turned to me, seeking help to conquer the puzzle. With a smile, I gladly assisted her, guiding her through the twists and turns. In that moment, as I watched her determination and charm, something within me shifted.<br><br>
              
              I had never been one to pay much attention to girls, but she was different. Her presence stood out, and I couldn't deny that I found her undeniably cute. From that day on, my eyes were drawn to her, and our shared connection over the Rubik's cube was the beginning of an unforgettable journey.<br><br>
              
              As the days turned into cherished memories, I realized that the Rubik's cube had not only brought us together but had also unveiled the start of a beautiful friendship, and perhaps something more.</p>

            <h2>Our love</h2>
            <p class="justified-text">Our love story continued to blossom, and we became an official couple. I'll never forget the unforgettable moment when I mustered the courage to confess my feelings for you, and your heartwarming response of "same" filled me with immense happiness. It felt like a dream come true.<br><br>

              As we embraced our newfound relationship, our love for each other grew stronger with each passing day. I couldn't help but show more and more of my affection for you, and to my pleasant surprise, you said yes to being with me just a week later. It was a whirlwind of emotions, and we couldn't believe how quickly we had become a couple. But deep down, we knew that our feelings for each other were genuine and profound.<br><br>
              
              Throughout the year, we shared many firsts togetherâ€”the magical first kiss in the computer shop, the tender first hug, and the sweet first time holding hands. And of course, with love comes the occasional disagreement, and we had our first fights too. I couldn't help but smile when you asked why we never argued, only to find ourselves in those passionate discussions later, even leading to some tears shed.<br><br>
              
              As the months passed, we faced challenges, needing to keep our relationship lowkey due to our religious beliefs. And there were others who tried to interfere and cause trouble, but our love for each other proved stronger than any obstacle.<br><br>
              
              We both had our flaws, but what made our love so special was how we embraced each other's strengths and weaknesses, accepting the ups and downs of life together. Our first anniversary celebration was a bit awkward but fun, as we sang our hearts out during a videoke bonding session in Baymall.<br><br>
              
              Through shared experiences, we learned each other's likes and dislikes, and every day, we eagerly looked forward to seeing each other. Your beauty in your uniform, especially in your PE uniform, never failed to captivate me. You were not just a girlfriend; you became the most cherished person in my life.
              
              As we reminisce about that year, I am filled with gratitude for the love we share and the memories we've created. Our journey together has been filled with joy, challenges, and unwavering love, and I know that our hearts are intertwined in a way that nothing can break us apart.</p>

            <h2>Our Struggles</h2>
          <p class="justified-text">In the length of our relationship, I can't even count how many times we've had arguments. Sometimes, it even escalates to raising our voices or threatening to break up, only to make up again with so much affection. But you know, amidst all our fights, I realized that we both get frustrated when we're not okay. It seems like we get more irritated when we can't make amends. I'm happy that despite our occasional clashes, we still refuse to sleep without resolving our issues.<br><br>

            To be honest, we struggled with bringing down our pride during arguments, but our deep love for each other made it clear that we will always find a way to reconcile. I've seen so many relationships break apart due to constant fights, but our strength prevails. Fortunately, we never let go of each other, especially during the times when we had to pretend to break up just to avoid suspicion. Now, your parents already know me, and they slowly accept our relationship.<br><br>
            
            The COVID-19 pandemic posed challenges for us too. Being so bored and unable to meet in person, we missed each other terribly, even though we often video call. But now, we're starting to do the things we enjoy, even with limitations. We're happy when we get the chance to see each other, and it's something we can't fully explain. Through all the struggles, fights, jealousy, and immaturity, I'm glad we faced them together and are still willing to confront any challenges our relationship may encounter.<br><br>
            
            I know we're stronger now because we both worship Jehovah. I pray to Him that we can fulfill the plans we often talk about and that He helps us endure until the day we can finally be together. I love you deeply, always.</p>

            <h2>My message for my beautiful darling</h2>
            <p class="justified-text">I don't even know what else to say, you might be getting tired of reading, haha, just kidding. But first and foremost, I want to say that I love you deeply, and I want to be with you until paradise. We may not believe in luck or superstitions, but I feel incredibly fortunate that I ended up with you. Sometimes, when you ask me if I love you, I just answer with a simple "yes." But the truth is, sometimes words fail me to express just how much I love you. It may sound cheesy, but even if I study all the languages in the world, it still wouldn't be enough to explain to you how much I love you and how beautiful you are.<br><br>
               Remember when I used to dream of experiencing an anniversary? Now, we're already at 5 years, hehe. Thank you for always making me feel loved. I know sometimes you feel guilty when we argue or when you worry that I might think you don't love me, but honestly, it shouldn't be a cause for concern. I'm simple, a little affection or a kiss from you is enough to make me happy. I miss you so much, and if I could, I wouldn't wait until 2028 to get married, I'd marry you right away and we'd go on dates everywhere. And Babi, I want us to move forward in all the things we need to do, making Jehovah the center of our relationship. Sometimes, I still feel guilty about what we did, but I'm sure He has already forgiven us and sees our efforts to change. Although sometimes I still feel the guilt, I choose to focus on the future. I think about when we'll be together or when we're in paradise. We'll be so much happier there, but while we wait for that, I want to focus on our spirituality. I want you to always remember that no matter what happens, I love you deeply and that will never change.<br><br>

               As I reflect on our journey together, I can't help but feel overwhelmed with gratitude for having you in my life. The road we've traveled hasn't always been smooth, but it's the bumps and obstacles we faced that made our love stronger and more resilient.
               
               I want you to know that even during the tough times, you've been my rock and my source of strength. Your unwavering support and understanding have carried us through the darkest moments, and your love has illuminated my life like a beacon of hope.
               
               I cherish the laughter and joy we share, the way you light up when we talk about our dreams and aspirations. It warms my heart to see the love in your eyes and feel the warmth of your embrace. With you, every day is an adventure, and every moment is filled with love.
               
               You've shown me what true love is, and I'm forever grateful for the love we share. Our connection runs deep, and I can't help but marvel at the way our souls are intertwined. You've brought so much meaning and purpose into my life, and I can't imagine a future without you by my side.
               
               No matter what challenges come our way, I promise to stand beside you, facing each obstacle together with courage and determination. I promise to cherish and nurture our love, and to always prioritize our happiness and well-being.
               
               I love you more with each passing day, and my heart overflows with joy knowing that you're mine. You've become an integral part of my life, and I can't wait to continue building a future filled with love, laughter, and endless possibilities.
               
               Thank you for being the love of my life, for making me feel cherished and adored. You are my soulmate, my confidant, and my best friend. I love you deeply and always will.</p>
